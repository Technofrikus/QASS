# QASS
QAZ-like for a BAE (Big Ass Enter) and 10u spacebar (7u+8u)

- v1.0 is tested and works with MIAO. XIAO would work as well but the pads on the underside I wanted to use are not GPIOs but only for a special serial protocol. So they cant be used.
- v1.1 is Untested, but I only made cosmetic changes, so should still work fine.

The latest version has the lower spacebar. Break off the lower part of the PCB and put it under the bottom row. Add headers at the connection points.

## BOM
- Miao MCU
- 3mm high hotswap headers and pins (the holes in the PCB a bigger than usual, so only the plastic part of the headers is on the PCB)
- 20x BAV70 diodes
