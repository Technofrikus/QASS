The stl includes all parts needed. Right click on it and split into parts. Move the plate and upper part away and group the bottom + logo. In OrcaSlicer this is done in the objects tab by marking all parts, right click and assemble.

The 3mf file are my print settings. Not sure if they work on your printer. Otherwise just import the stl.

Use two different colors for the logo and the rest.

I would recommend using variable layer height. The auto settings + smooth work fine. Otherwise the two faces touching the plate have big layer heights and it doesnt look as good.

Supports: bottom yes, other parts no

I use 3 perimeters, but 2 should work as well.
